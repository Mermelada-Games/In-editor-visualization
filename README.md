## Tools

In the **Tools** section, users can select which session to represent in the scene.

Additionally, users can choose the **Time Range** for data visualization by defining a **Start Time** and an **End Time**.  
There is also an option to reset the visualization to the full available time range.

Markers have their own labels for names. In this section, both the marker shape size and the label size can be adjusted to improve visibility.
